### Introduction
In this course we will do a sequence of labs, the end goal of which is to develop a Security Benchmarking Tool (SBT). These labs will familiarize us with instruments used in IT security departments of different companies as well as give us practical experience in developing them. Concretely, we will be working with cyber security audit policies - benchmarks that allow a security officer to assess a systemâ€™s vulnerability to different attacks and enforce certain security configurations based on community best practices.
